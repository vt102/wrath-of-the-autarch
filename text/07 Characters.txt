<chapter>Characters</chapter>
The term character is used broadly. It refers not only to the heroes of the Stronghold, but to any leaders, monsters, minions, and henchmen. All characters are described using aspects, skills, stunts, stress, and consequences. Military units are also treated as characters, and are described using the same five elements (see the <chapref>Warfare</chapref> chapter).
<h1>Heroes</h1>
The term <term>hero</term> is used exclusively to refer to the characters that the Stronghold players take control of. Such characters may not actually reflect a heroic archetype in play, but it serves to distinguish those characters in the text.
<h2>Aspects</h2>?
Heroes have three aspects that are used to describe them. As mentioned in the Fate chapter, aspects are arguably the most important part of the game, and learning how to leverage them is a good skill.
<h3>Core Concept</h3>
The best way to think of the core concept is to imagine how you would concisely describe the character concept to another person. More than any of the other aspects, the core concept should portray the essence of the character. Sample core concepts: <aspect>Commander of the Tarmaeth Legion</aspect>, <aspect>Shadow Council Assassin</aspect>, <aspect>World Weary Animal Tamer</aspect>.
<h3>Trouble</h3>
Every hero has trouble, weaknesses either internal or external that make life difficult. The trouble aspect is a great source for endures or compels. It’s good to make sure the aspect isn’t so narrow that it’s never applicable. Sample troubles: <aspect>Drink to Silence the Screams</aspect>, <aspect>Never Subtle</aspect>, <aspect>In Debt to the Ghall Clan</aspect>.
<h3>Legacy</h3>
The Stronghold has five aspects, and during the process of character creation, each hero is somehow related to one of those aspects. See the <chapref>Getting Started</chapref> chapter for more details. Typically, the legacy aspect signifies what sort of position within the Stronghold the hero holds, but it can also tie the hero to some element of the Stronghold’s history. Frequently the core concept also ties the hero into the Stronghold via rank or position, in which case this aspect can be used to clarify some other part of the hero’s role. Sample legacy aspects: <aspect>Medium-sized Fish in a Small Pond</aspect>, <aspect>Echo Lake Farmer</aspect>, <aspect>Warfare Guild Journeyman</aspect>, <aspect>Veteran of the Sunrider Wars</aspect>.
<h2>Relationships</h2>
Heroes have relationships with other heroes as well as with leaders from other factions. When a hero is created, they start with two relationship aspects, one for a helpful relationship with another hero, and another for a hindering relationship. The process for creating a relationship is to first pick a character and a skill. Finally, a description is added to the relationship that involves the skill.
Helpful relationships indicate friendship and camaraderie, like <aspect>Fighter - Aria Has Pledged Her Sword For Me</aspect>, <aspect>Lore - Gareth is my Mentor</aspect>, <aspect>Stealth - Ellie has my Back</aspect>. Hindering relationships could involve jealousy, irritation, or rough spots from the past. For example, <aspect>Science - Maelgwn Never Trusts My Input</aspect>, <aspect>Intimidation - Ollie Broke My Heart</aspect>, <aspect>Empathy - Tyra is Self-centered</aspect>.
It is possible to get more relationships with stunts. Sometimes during the mission it’s desirable to use Create Advantage to create aspects that are relationships with different characters. These relationships useful during the game, but aren’t elevated to the level of relationship aspects that are added to the character sheet.
<h3>Using Helpful Aspects</h3>
Whenever the hero is in a scene or conflict with the character they share a helpful relationship with, they may use the helpful aspect. During the challenge phase, they are with the character if they are in the same scene or providing some aid in the case of making mission or campaign aspects. During a conflict, they are with the character if they are within sight of each other. If a helpful aspect applies to the skill being checked, add fortune to the result.
<h3>Using Hindering Aspects</h3>
Whenever the hero is with the character they have a hindering relationship with, the Stronghold player may hinder the skill check. Similarly to helpful aspects, they must be in the same scene or conflict as the hindering character.
If the hindering relationship is used, one skill advance may be taken for the skill. This is in addition to any other skill advances that may be taken. In exchange, misfortune is applied to the skill check. Being around frustrating people is one way to grow and learn!
<h2>Skills</h2>
Skills are broad areas of expertise and ability that characters possess. Heroes start with one Great (+4) skill, two Good (+3) skills, three Fair (+2) skills, and four Average (+1) skills. The rest of the skills start at Mediocre (+0). Over the course of the campaign, skills can improve and increase in rank. The only restriction is that every skill above the Mediocre rank must have at least one skill below it in rank.
<h2>Stunts</h2>
Stunts are special abilities and improvements tied to skills. Each hero starts with one stunt for their Great (+4) skill. Each time a skill advances to the rank of Great (+4) or above, the hero may take one stunt for that skill. Stunts are listed under each skill description in the <chapref>Skills and Stunts</chapref> chapter.
<h2>Stress and Consequences</h2>
Stress and Consequences are a way to handle duress, hardships, and even injuries as well as functioning as a pacing mechanism. Heroes start with a physical stress track of length two as well as a mental stress track of length two. A Physique skill above Mediocre (+0) gives the hero extra physical stress boxes and a possible bonus consequences, and a Will skill above Mediocre (+0) gives the hero extra mental stress boxes and a possible bonus consequence. See the <chapref>Skills and Stunts</chapref> chapter for the specifics.
Heroes also start with a minor (-2), major (-4), and severe (-6) consequence. Minor and major consequence take one season to recover, while severe consequence takes two seasons. Consequences function as aspects when they’re taken, and get a free invoke. Consequences can be fairly broad, representing physical damage (<aspect>Sprained Ankle</aspect>), mental anguish (<aspect>Night Terrors</aspect>), or even obligations (<aspect>Debt to Heinrich</aspect>) and passions (<aspect>Infatuated with Ellis</aspect>).
Heroes can go on missions with consequences, although naturally it’s riskier.
<h2>Taken Out</h2>
As described in the Taking Damage section of the <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> chapter, if a character must take stress but has no more stress boxes or consequences to mitigate the stress, they are taken out.
A character getting taken out doesn’t necessarily mean they are killed. It means the character is removed from the mission and may take no more actions. The nature of what it means to be taken out depends on the type of conflict. In a social situation, it could mean the character is shamed or embarrassed and doesn’t want to continue on. Or they owe a debt to another character. In combat, the character might not be in any shape to fight any longer.
Faction leaders and heroes in particular may only be killed through assassination. Even if they are taken out during skirmish or warfare, they are presumed to not be killed. Monsters, lieutenants, and minions are killed for good if they are taken out.
<h1>Leaders</h1>
<term>Leaders</term> are important and possibly recurring characters in the campaign aside from the heroes. Leaders include the faction leaders, the set of influential characters described for each faction, as well as boss monsters and other central adversaries. Leaders are built very similarly to heroes, with the key difference coming from how skills and stunts are chosen.
<h2>Aspects</h2>
Leaders typically have three aspects, which don’t have to be categorized as the hero aspects do.
<h2>Skills</h2>
Leaders are built around a <term>skill cap</term>, which gives a rough indicator of their overall ability and indicates the highest skill rank they can have. When building a leader, the first step is to identify the skill cap.
Instead of a skill pyramid, leaders begin with two skills at the same rank as their skill cap, and two skills every rank below that down to Average (+1). The rest of their skills are Mediocre (+0). So, instead of a pyramid, leader skills form a column of width two. Most faction leaders have a Superb (+5) skill cap, while boss monsters generally have a skill cap based on the difficulty of the mission. Unlike heroes, leaders never improve their skills over the course of the campaign.
<h2>Stunts</h2>
Leaders get stunts equal to one-half their skill cap value, rounded down. They have no restrictions on where these stunts come from as heroes do. These stunts may not come from any skill lists, but might be custom abilities given to unique monsters or powerful faction leaders.
<h2>Stress and Consequences</h2>
Stress tracks and starting consequences are calculated for leaders are the same as they are for heroes. However, leaders do not have a severe consequence unless a stunt specifically allows it.
<h1>Lieutenants</h1>
Lieutenants are minor characters that fill important roles for factions when leaders aren’t available. They might be head guards, military captains, or even diplomats. Lieutenants can also be minor monsters that work with a leader monster as adversaries in a Skirmish.
<h2>Aspects</h2>
Lieutenants have two aspects.
<h2>Skills</h2>
Lieutenants use a skill cap as leaders do, but only have one skill at the same rank as their skill cap, and one skill for each rank below that. They have a skill column of width one.
<h2>Stunts</h2>
Lieutenants have a number of stunts equal to one-half their skill cap, as per leaders.
<h2>Stress and Consequences</h2>
Lieutenants do not have moderate or severe consequences unless they are from stunts. Otherwise, stress and consequences work the same as for leaders.
<h1>Minions</h1>
Minions are the nameless, faceless adversaries that are but speed bumps toward the heroes’ ultimate goal. They might be guards in a castle or packs of goblins under the service of an orc king.
<h2>Aspects</h2>
Minions get two aspects.
<h2>Skills</h2>
Minions are built using a skill column of width one as lieutenants are.
<h2>Stunts</h2>
Minions have at most one stunt, related to their role, although they may have none.
<h2>Stress and Consequences</h2>
The stress tracks for minions are calculated as for leaders and lieutenants (base of two, possibly modified by high Physique and Will skills). Minions don’t have any consequences.
<h2>No Skill Minions</h2>
As an option, minions may have no skills at all. Instead, whenever they take an action, they add the mission difficulty to the check. In essence, all of their skills are equal to the mission difficulty. Minions with no skills always have physical and mental stress tracks of length two and don’t have stunts.
This option is best used when minions must be created quickly, and fleshing out individual skills doesn’t matter much. Creating guards for infiltration missions is a good time to use no skill minions. Diplomats for diplomacy threats also work well as no skill minions.
<h1>Assets</h1>
Through stunts or aspect burning, the players may have access to assets. Assets are not first class characters with their own actions, but are instead tied closely to the hero. They might be animal companions, familiars, squires, torchbearers, magical amulets, or artifacts. Only heroes and leaders have assets, and they can’t have more than one asset at the same time.
<h2>Aspects</h2>
Assets have a core concept, much like a character. These can be invoked or used in challenge scene complications as normal.
<h2>Helpful and Hindering Aspects</h2>
Assets have both hindering and helpful skills, that function as relationships do (although no character needs to be in the same scene to use them). Each time an asset gains a helpful skill, they also gain a hindering skill. One aspect is created to describe how the asset helps or hinders with each listed skill.
<h2>Stress and Consequences</h2>
Assets do not have any stress tracks. It’s possible they may have a minor consequence. Asset consequences may be taken by the controlling player instead of using their own consequences. Assets may never be targeted directly and they may not be killed or destroyed unless desired by the controlling hero.
<h2>Aspect Burning</h2>
As mentioned in the <chapref>Core Rules</chapref> chapter, aspects may be converted into assets or improve existing assets. Only free invokes from campaign aspects may be burned in this way. The number of free invokes that must be converted is based on the number of helpful/hindering pairs of skills the asset has. The listed number of free invokes must be burned to add one helpful and one hindering skill.
